# NYCU Spring 2025 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
## Introduction
Our problem is to generate new handwritten characters that imitate the unique handwriting style of a specific person based on their few-shot samples.
 We aim to develop a model that can produce visually consistent characters reflecting that person's writing style.
 This includes generating characters that were not part of the original samples, demonstrating the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.
